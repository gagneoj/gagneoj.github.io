    <p class="one">Born and raised in the Manassas area of northern Virginia, I have been lucky enough to experience all sorts of things. I attended Nokesville schools from the first grade until my graduation from Brentsville District High School in 2020. After graduation, I enrolled at Mary Baldwin University, as a first-generation college student. Currently, I am in the spring semester of my junior year. </p>
    <p class="two">At Mary Baldwin University, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. In addition to my studies, I am also a member of the varsity softball team where I play short stop and third base. This past fall, I took a step out of my comfort zone and served as an Orientation Leader for the incoming class of 2026. It was an amazing experience that taught me a lot about leadership, hard work, and balance. </p>
    <p class="three">After I complete my undergraduate degree I am looking to enter the planning and zoning field. I have always been fascinated by puzzles and problems that require great thought and collaboration. I feel a career in planning and zoning would be perfect for me because not only can I work in an office setting, but also get to work out and about in the community. A bonus I look forward to in the planning and zoning field is that I can work directly in my community. Having a chance to make a difference in the community I live in and serve is one of the greatest benefits a job can provide. </p>
    <p class="four">In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities. I have an 11 year old niece and a two year old nephew who I just adore. Any chance I get to visit with them, I do. Being that I grew up in the northern Virginia area my whole life, I am a huge Washington sports team. One of my favorite activities is attending and watching Nationals baseball games and Capitals hockey games with my boyfriend. Lastly, I enjoy volunteering my time in my local community in any way that I can. There is no greater joy than giving back to the community that helped raise me.</p>
